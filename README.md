# 🍽️ Recipe Website

This is a simple **HTML project** created as part of my learning journey through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).  
It’s a basic web page that showcases **three popular Indian dishes** — **Vada Pav**, **Paneer Tikka**, and **Chole Bhature**.

---

## 🔧 Project Overview

- Built using **pure HTML** (no frameworks or external libraries).  
- Each recipe page includes:
  - A title and image of the dish  
  - A short description  
  - List of ingredients  
  - Step-by-step preparation method  
- Connected and hosted using **GitHub Pages** for easy viewing online.

## 📚 Purpose

This project helped me practice:
- Structuring HTML pages properly  
- Using tags like `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<p>`, `<img>`, `<a>`, etc.  
- Organizing files into a simple website
